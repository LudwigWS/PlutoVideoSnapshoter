1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,770
today I would like to provide the

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,899
American people with an update on the

3
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:06,240
White House transition and our policy

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,820
plans for the first 100 days our

5
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,190
transition team is working very smoothly

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,490
efficiently and effectively truly great

7
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,800
and talented men and women patriots

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,289
indeed are being brought in and many

9
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:20,910
will soon be a part of our government

10
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:23,510
helping us to make America great again

11
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,640
my agenda will be based on a simple core

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,789
principle putting America first whether

13
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:32,550
it's producing steel building cars or

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,710
curing disease I want the next

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,930
generation of production and innovation

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,660
to happen right here on our great

17
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,540
homeland America creating wealth and

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,270
jobs for American workers as part of

19
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:47,460
this plan I've asked my transition team

20
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,039
to develop a list of executive actions

21
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,039
we can take on day one to restore a laws

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,890
and bring back our jobs it's about time

23
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,280
these include the following on trade I'm

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,289
going to issue our notification of

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:03,180
intent to withdraw from the

26
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,030
trans-pacific partnership a potential

27
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,119
disaster for our country instead we will

28
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,310
negotiate fair bilateral trade deals

29
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,590
that bring jobs and industry back onto

30
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,830
American shores on energy I will cancel

31
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,780
job-killing restrictions on the

32
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,360
production of American energy including

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,000
shale energy and clean coal creating

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,670
many millions of high-paying jobs that's

35
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,640
what we want that's what we've been

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,189
waiting for on regulation I will

37
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:33,960
formulate a rule which says that for

38
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,750
every one new regulation too old

39
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,140
regulations must be eliminated so

40
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:43,290
important or national security I will

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,420
ask the Department of Defense and the

42
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,430
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to

43
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,920
develop a comprehensive plan to protect

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
America's vital infrastructure from

45
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,960
cyber attacks and all other form of

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,290
attacks on immigration I will direct the

47
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,479
Department of Labor to investigate all

48
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,479
abuses of visa programs that undercut

49
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,990
the American worker on ethics reform as

50
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,390
part of our plan to drain the swamp

51
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,550
we will impose a five-year ban on

52
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,620
executive officials becoming Lobby

53
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,930
is after they leave the administration

54
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,510
and a lifetime ban on executive

55
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,700
officials lobbying on behalf of a

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,220
foreign government these are just a few

57
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,140
of the steps we will take to reform

58
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,959
Washington and rebuild our middle class

59
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:30,420
I will provide more updates in the

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,879
coming days as we work together to make

61
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,640
America great again for everyone and I

62
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,970
mean everyone
